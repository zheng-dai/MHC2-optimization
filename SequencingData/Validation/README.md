This folder contains data generated from the defined-peptide libraries for testing peptide optimizations and the processing pipeline.

Peptide lists for the original selection ('replicate 1') and a replicate selection ('replicate 2') contain read counts for each allele and round (e.g. count_R0-401 for Round 0, HLA-DR401).

Processing files include a Bash file for assembling paired-end reads via PANDAseq (Masella et al, BMC Bioinformatics 2012) and Jupyter Notebook for extracting and filtering peptide sequences.

Deep sequencing data are deposited on the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with accession code PRJNA708266 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA708266).
